# Bite-Byte

I built this Android application for a college project and to learn the basics of Android development. It gets the current GPS location and locates restaurants in the area of the user by using Google Places. 

The results are displayed using Google Places JavaScript V3 API and an Android WebView. The html file is stored locally in  the assets folder. To pass the GPS coordinates to the Google API I implemented the Java/JavaScript interface in the WebView to allow JavaScript on the webpage access to the variables.

This application was tested on an HTC EVO running Android 2.3.
